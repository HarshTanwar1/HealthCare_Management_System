## 📖 Overview

The **E-Health Care Management System** is a Java Swing desktop application that replaces paper-based hospital record-keeping with a simple, database-backed workflow. Staff can securely log in, admit and discharge patients, search records, and generate a discharge bill automatically — all from an intuitive multi-window interface backed by a relational database over JDBC.

> Built end-to-end: from GUI design and event handling, to JDBC data access, to packaging a distributable runnable JAR

<br>

## 🌟 Key Highlights

- 🖥️ **End-to-end desktop app** — every layer built from scratch: GUI, event handling, data access, and packaging into a runnable JAR.
- 🗄️ **Real database integration** — full CRUD on patient records over JDBC with Apache Derby.
- 🔐 **Two-tier access control** — staff login plus an admin-key gate for registering new users.
- 🧾 **Automated billing logic** — bills are derived from admit/discharge date arithmetic, not entered by hand.
- 📅 **Thoughtful UX touches** — calendar date picker, live searchable record table, and auto-suggested patient numbers.
- 📦 **Distributable build** — packaged with Apache Ant, bundling all dependencies for one-command launch.

## ✨ Features & Functionality

- 🔐 **Staff Login** — authenticates users against the `HOSPITAL_STAFF` table.
- 🛡️ **Admin-gated Registration** — new accounts require an admin key before a staff member can be registered.
- 🧭 **Task Dashboard** — a central menu that routes to every operation in the system.
- ➕ **Admit Patient** — records name, ailment, and admit date (via a calendar picker) and auto-suggests the next free patient number.
- 🚪 **Discharge Patient** — looks up a patient, updates their status, and opens the billing window.
- 🧾 **Automatic Billing** — computes the bill from the number of days admitted (₹500/day).
- 🔎 **View & Search Records** — displays all patients in a live table and supports searching by name.

<br>

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **JDK 13+**
- **Apache Derby (JavaDB)** with the network server running on `localhost:1527`
- **Apache Ant** _(optional — only to build from source; NetBeans can build/run too)_

### 1️⃣ Set up the database

Start the Derby network server, create a database named **`Apex Hospital`** (user `root`, password `abc`), and create the tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE HOSPITAL_STAFF (
    USERNAME VARCHAR(50),
    PASSWORD VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE PATIENTS (
    PATIENT_NUMBER   INT PRIMARY KEY,
    PATIENT_NAME     VARCHAR(100),
    PATIENT_AILMENT  VARCHAR(100),
    STATUS           VARCHAR(20),
    ADMITDATE        VARCHAR(20),
    DISCHARGEDATE    VARCHAR(20)
);
```

> 💡 The connection details (`jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/Apex Hospital`, user `root` / password `abc`) are defined in each frame — adjust them if your setup differs

### 2️⃣ Run the application

**Option A — pre-built JAR**

```bash
cd dist
java -jar "E-Health_Care_Management_System.jar"
```

_(The `dist/lib` folder must sit next to the JAR)_

**Option B — build from source with Ant**

```bash
ant clean
ant jar
ant run        # main class: healthlet.NewJFrame
```

**Option C — NetBeans** → open the project and press **Run (F6)**. Main class: `healthlet.NewJFrame`

<br>

## 🎓 What I Learned

- Designing **multi-window Java Swing** applications and managing navigation between `JFrames`.
- Using the **NetBeans GUI Builder** to lay out forms and wire up event-driven button handlers.
- Connecting Java to a relational database with **JDBC** — executing `INSERT` / `SELECT` / `UPDATE` queries and reading `ResultSet`s.
- Populating a Swing `JTable` dynamically from query results with `DefaultTableModel`.
- Integrating third-party components (the **JCalendar** date picker) and formatting dates with `SimpleDateFormat`.
- Implementing real business logic, like deriving a bill from date arithmetic.
- Packaging a Java desktop app into a **distributable runnable JAR** with Ant and bundled dependencies.

<br>

## 🔭 Future Improvements

- **🔒 Use `PreparedStatement`** — queries are currently built via string concatenation, which is open to SQL injection and breaks on special characters. Parameterized queries fix both.
- **♻️ Adopt try-with-resources** — to auto-close connections and prevent resource leaks.
- **🏛️ Apply MVC** — separating UI, business logic, and data access would make the app testable and maintainable.
- **🏷️ Rename auto-generated classes** — `NewJFrame1`…`NewJFrame5` → `Dashboard`, `AddPatientFrame`, etc.
- **⚙️ Make billing configurable** and add input validation.
